My program sometimes has this problem. When you run the application for the first time and try to log in to a common user, the page Invalid User is returned for the first time. 
However, the page becomes OK returning the cat page in second login try. 
If you encounter this situation, please try again, my shopping cart do can be connected to the shopping cart.
